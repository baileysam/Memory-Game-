## Sam Bailey Memory Game ##

Single-Page HTML5/CSS3/Javascript memory game.

## The Purpose Of The Game? ##
The purpose of this game is to compete with friends and try to get the best time so you can get on the leaderboard and challenge your friends it also to challenges your memory.

## The Layout. ##
For the layout I have the main game cards on the left, then I have my controls panel in the middle with a text box to enter your name and a start/restart button I have made this clear by using icons. The game timer is also in this panel. And the leaderboard is on the right where your scores will show, I have used icons to clearly show your place on the leaderboard.

## Colors And Fonts ##
For my colors I have used a red, white and blue the red is ``` #F7013B ``` and the blue is that color inverted ``` #00F1BB ``` I have used the red and white on my cards to make the look like normal playing cards. And have used the same colors for my panel borders.

## Interactive Elements ##
My interactive elements are the main cards will spin when you press the start button then you have two seconds to memorise where all the pairs are. When clicked if two cards match they will disappear, if they dont match they will spin back round till you find a match. Also the name box and start/restart button when clicked will go grey so you know you can't press it again when the color comes back hit the button again and the game will restart.

## File Structure ##

I have added a README.md file to help myself for futre development also it is good practice and it will help any other developers who come across my work understand it better.
 
## CSS ##
In my CSS I have used BEM formatting so it can easily be reused when needed also It makesIt much easier to follow. Here Is a link explaining a bit more about BEM formatting. http://getbem.com/introduction/ 
I have given my elements semantic class names to keep It simple and again make It easy to use.
I have stayed consistent with my colors, fonts, padding and margin.
for the margin and padding I have been usingIncrements of 8px so Its easy to follow.

## Animations ##
I have a animation on the timer that makes the number bigger every 10 seconds to make you feel the pressure of the timer running out and for the last five seconds the timer flashes red. Also the restart icon will spin when clicked. A card flipping animation has been made to make the game more appealing.

## Iconography ##
For my icons I am using the FontAwsome icon library, I have used their icons to clearly show the start button is also the restart button. I have also used FontAwsome for all of my icons on the cards and the design on the backs.
